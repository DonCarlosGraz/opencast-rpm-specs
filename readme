This repository contains the spec files for creating all necessary RPMs for
running Opencast Matterhorn.

The inclusion of the EPEL repository from the Fedora project and the rpmforge
repository is necessary to build and run these files. The build process was
tested on a system running CentOS 6.2 and Scientific Linux 6.2, both with a
x86_64 architecture.

Important: This repository only contains the spec files. The source files can
			  be either retrieved directly from upstream or bundled with the specs
			  from the source repository located at:
			  http://lernfunk.de/matterhorn_3rd-party_repo/CentOS/6/SRPMS/

			  If you only want to build your own RPM repository, I highly
			  encourage you to use the source RPMs instead of downloading all
			  source files by yourself. If you have improvements for the specs
			  however, it would be nice if you fork this git repository and send
			  me a pull request so that I can integrate them into the source
			  repository and  everyone can benefit from your changes.
