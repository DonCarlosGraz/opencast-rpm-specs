This repository contains the spec files to create all necessary RPMs for
Opencast Matterhorn. This includes:
 - Opencast Matterhorn itself (With different distributions, profiles, …)
 - All 3rd-Party-Tools needed by Matterhorn and not included in the default
   CentOS, Scientific Linux or Fedora EPEL repositories.

For CentOS and Scientific Linux, The inclusion of the EPEL repository from the
Fedora project is necessary to build and run these files. The build process was
tested on a system running CentOS 5.8, 6.2 and Scientific Linux 6.2, both with
a x86_64 architecture.

Important: This repository only contains the spec files. The source files can
           be either retrieved directly from upstream or bundled with the specs
           from the source repository located at:
           http://lernfunk.de/matterhorn-repo/SRPMS/

           If you only want to build your own RPM repository, I highly
           encourage you to use the source RPMs instead of downloading all
           source files by yourself. If you have improvements for the specs
           however, it would be nice if you fork this git repository and send
           pull requests for the improved specs, so that I can integrate them
           into the source repository and everyone can benefit from your
           changes.
